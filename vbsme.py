''' read in i, j, k, l. The variables i and j are the frame dimensions frame[i][j], and k and l are the window dimensions window[k][l]
The variables x and y are the top left coordinate of the window. x and y are initialized to zero because we need to start at 
top left corner of the frame, (0, 0).

for x = 0; x <= i - k; x++
