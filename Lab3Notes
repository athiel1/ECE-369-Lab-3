Notes

Variables in Code:



Registers:
only registers we are allowed to store values in during program execution: 
$t0 - $t9
$s0 - $s7

registers for final result:
$v0 - $v1


Variables:
$a0 -> address of first element in asize
$a1 -> address of first element in frame
$a2 -> address of first element in window

$s0 -> i (frame rows)
$s1 -> j (frame columns)
$s2 -> k (window rows)
$s3 -> l (window columns)

$s4 -> offset

$s5 ->

$s6 -> r (current row)
$s7 -> c (current column)

$t0 -> pointer to current element in frame
$t1 -> pointer to current element in window

$t2 -> current SAD
$t3 -> lowest SAD
$t4 -> index
$t5 -> lowest index
$t6 -> checks lteq


$v0 -> lowestR  
$v1 -> lowestC 


TEMPS AVALIABLE:
$t7
$t8
$t9
