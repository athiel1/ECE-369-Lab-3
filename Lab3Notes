Notes


Registers:
only registers we are allowed to store values in during program execution: 
$t0 - $t9
$s0 - $s7

registers for final result:
$v0 - $v1



Variables:
$a0 -> address of first element in asize
$a1 -> address of first element in frame
$a2 -> address of first element in window

$s0 -> i (frame rows)
$s1 -> j (frame columns)
$s2 -> k (window rows)
$s3 -> l (window columns)

$s4 -> pointer to current element in frame
$s5 -> pointer to current element in window

$s6 -> lowest SAD
$s7 -> index



**do not change following temps**
$t0 -> r (current row)
$t1 -> c (current column)
$t2 -> sad
$t3 -> offset
$t4 -> (i - k - offset)
$t5 -> *reserved for inner loops*



**TEMPS AVALIABLE FOR USE**
$t6 -> 
$t7 -> 
$t8 -> 
$t9 -> 



Return Values:
$v0 -> lowestR  
$v1 -> lowestC
